# PhotogrammatryTable

This is a design of a rotary table that can be used to 3D scan objects.

The turntable consists of a 3D printable housing, a stepper motor with stepper motor driver, an ESP32.

It can be controlled by a serial connection, but also wireless by an M5Stack, if you have one available.
